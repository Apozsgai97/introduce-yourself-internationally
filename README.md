# Introduce Yourself Internationally

## A simple fullstack application with TypeScript and Node.js

This project was built for a weekend assignment in School of Applied Technology. The main objective was to create a simple fullstack application with clean, well-structured code.

## Project idea

When traveling to a different country, the easiest way to connect with locals is by speaking their native language. I wanted to create an application that helps you introduce yourself in various languages. 

## Used concepts

* A fullstack application with TypeScript and Node.js
* HTTP-server to run the code.
* Test Driven Development
* Separated the functional core and the imperative shell.
* Microsteps with expectations.
* Incorporate a new technical concept (SQLite).

## New technical concept

In the initial version of my application, I used mock data, but I later decided to implement a real database; SQLite. My learning journey was guided by a <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/">Frontend Masters</a> course, "Complete intro to SQLite" by Brian Holt. The course offers organized lectures and well-structured documentation, with the ability to search through key topics. Additionally, I used the browser to find specific solutions to particular problems.

## Installation 

* Install with npm i
* Run backend and frontend at the same time. 
* Frontend: npm i dev
* Backend: npm i build + npm i start
